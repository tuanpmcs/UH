    "THE PROBLEM\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been in a fancy restaurant with four of your best friends. All the individual bills are brought to the table and it is time to add the tip and to compute everyone’s share. Since nobody ordered anything extravagantly expensive, you decide that everyone will pay an equal share of the bill.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside your program, you have to declare Ten variables: one for each of the names and one for each of the bills. Assume the group has five people. Request names of the five attendees and store them in variables ‘name1’, …, ‘name5’. Then assign bills for each person and store each of them in the corresponding variables: ‘bill1’, …,’bill5’. Print out both of those sets of variables. Next ask for input for the tip percentage and compute and print the total bill and the amount each person must pay.\n",
    "\n",
    " You are  NOT ALLOWED to use for loops or lists.  All variables must be declared and used.  You will get a ZERO if you  not comply with the instructions.\n",
